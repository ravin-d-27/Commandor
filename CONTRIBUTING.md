## ✅ Code Guidelines
- Follow PEP8 coding style for Python

- Add comments for tricky logic
- Always test your changes before pushing
- For destructive shell commands → add safety checks


## 🧪 Testing
To test locally:
```bash
commandor
```
You can try commands like:
```bash
/ai list all .py files
/ask What is Docker?
```
If adding new features, write test cases to verify functionality.
